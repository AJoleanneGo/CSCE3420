            Whatever it is, I'm up for the challenge.

            IT and Technical Communication
          </h2>
          <p>
            Yes! They are two fields that work extremely well together. Every field needs a technical writer for documentation, especially IT. I can fit into any major IT role with my
            specializations. Here are a few examples of that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Business Analyst:</b> This role works closely with documentation, creating project requirement documents and many times, presenting to a team of people. Clearly and concisely
              communicating benefits analyst roles greatly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Technical Writer:</b> business professionals work closely to document IT processes, and a lot of times, technical writers rely on subject matter experts to do their job. A degree in
              IT helps bridge that gap.
            </li>
          </ul><br>

          <h2>
            Loving Writing
          </h2>
          <p>
            My knack for organization drove me to really love English and writing. I was always a stickler for the detailsÃ¢â‚¬â€be it how organized the output in my code was, to the nuances of words,
            their meanings, and their implications in sentences. I always want to communicate what I need done in a clear and succinct way, where there is no room for misunderstanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it might be strange loving something mundane like writing reports, analysis, documentation, and emails, but it's pretty useful sometimes!

            Growing into Coding
          </h2>
          <p>
            I was told I had a knack for languageÃ¢â‚¬â€I was born outside America and learned to balance English and Filipino, my home language, in order to learn to communicate with my relatives and
            the people at school. However, senior year of high school, I had found Computer Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coding was a language that seemed to challenge all of my skills, from the creativity of the arts, to the problem-solving skills of math and science, to even the clarity and succinctness
            that I have learned from language. I was hooked. I have learned Java, and with my major, now take on the challenge of learning other programming languages like C, C++, html, CSS,
            JavaScript and more. Every project to me ignites my passion for learning, as it has always been an excitement to me to find the results of each line of code as it compiles and runs.

            Getting into Design
          </h2>
          <p>
            In highschool, I always enrolled into every art elective and joined every art competition. I consistently placed the highest ranking in Visual Art Scholastic Events for all four years,
            and I really liked it. I've always had a knack for design. Making something look good is just something that I'm compelled to do at all times, even when it's not required!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I've mastered several design software like Clip Studio, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. I continue my artistic pursuits in school as a technical communicator in UI / UX
            fields!
